# HRX Journal CMS

A content management system for the HRX Journal project.

## Getting Started

1. Create environment variables file:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

2. Update the environment variables so that none are empty. You can get the variables from a teammate.

**Never commit this file, as it has secrets that can be stolen.** If you commit it, contact Katherine, Brandon, or Rocky for instructions on how to remove it from your git history. Simply deleting and recommitting, **will not work**.

3. Run the development script:

```sh
yarn run develop
```
